# Git Ignore Tracked File Changes

Sometimes certain files are tracked and committed to a repository for continuous deployments. However, sometimes slight adjustments will want to be made for local development operations that should **never** be committed back to `origin`.

Additionally, some files are automatically updated when performing operations to test a site locally, such as cache files, that should also **never** be committed back up to `origin`.

To ignore changes to certain tracked files, Git can be told to assume certain files are unchangedâ€”which effectively means Git will ignore any changes to these files.

```bash
# git update-index --assume-unchanged <file>...
git update-index --assume-unchanged docker-compose.yml wp-config.php
```

To stop ignoring changes and begin tracking them again, prefix the option with `no`:

```bash
# git update-index --no-assume-unchanged <file>...
git update-index --no-assume-unchanged docker-compose.yml
```

## List Files Marked as `--assume-unchaged`

```bash
git ls-files -v | grep '^[a-z]'
```
