## About

I'm Michelle, a full-stack WordPress developer. In my spare time, I enjoy working on a few WordPress plugins of my own! I believe in quality over quantity. For that reason, I prefer finely crafting a few plugins rather than maintaining a plethora of mediocre projects.

My favorite words are "clean", "simple", and "efficient".
